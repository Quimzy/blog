Let's start with the apparent fact: <em>the world is built of squares and we are dying inside of them</em></p>
<p>They won. They truly did. They trapped humanity into small elegant boxes with very low roofs. </p>
<p>Who am I even talking about? There's no <strong><em>They</em></strong>. We've done this to ourselves. It's not the liberal West, nor the commies, nor the Illumaniti, not even the fucking lizard people. It's us, all along.</p>
<p>A civilization's biggest enemy is <strong>chaos</strong>. That's why we create religions, laws, social norms -- <em>boxes</em>. </p>
<p>That's why melodies now are easy and shallow. That's why every Instagram story is the same as the one before it. That's why each time you go to a new place, you have a deja-vu.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about being different and special and creative. Weirdness has been rendered bland, tasteless, repetitive and orthodox. It's all about corporates, brands, executives, and managers.</p>
<p>You manslaughtered your kids, other people's kids, and even the sperm that hasn't entered the egg yet.</p>
<p>We do all of this to escape; in the hopes of eradicating every trace of disorder around us. And everytime we do this, we die a little more. </p>
<p>I mean, haven't you heard? <em>Entropy kills all</em>.

<p><strong><em>"So WTF should I do now?"</em></strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry. Did I depress you? Was I too nihilistic and pessimistic for you? I wish I could've answered that question with a more pink-y, flower-y world view. But, sadly, I cannot. So bare with me.</p>
<p>Well, first things first, this is NOT a plea for Anarchism. Anarchism is NOT the answer. You will never take down the Meta or the Big Box. Simply, because there's no Meta or Big Box.</p>
<p>There's only a web of interconnected, lower-case metas and boxes. And, you can't escape those by burning down supermarkets, blowing up towers -whether from inside with a bomb or outside with a plane ;)-, or hacking NASA. </p>
<p><strong><em>"Okay then, how can I esca-"</em></strong></p>
<p>Can you just wait? I broke the 4th wall twice already. Jeez. TikTok has really made you impacient.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. Here's the answer: </p>
