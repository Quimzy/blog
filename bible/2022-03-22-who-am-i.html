<p>A poorly written pseudocode that describes Quimzy's day.</p>
<p>```
function think(topics) is
  topic = a random topic from topics
  idea = a random idea from that topic 
  return idea</p>
<p>function brain() is
  topics = [physics, math, computer_science]<br />
  idea = think(topics)
  if idea.type() = theory is
    wonder(idea) //too lazy to write a function for this right now
  else
    create(idea)</p>
<p>function quimzy() is
  tasks = []
  while len(tasks) &gt; 3 //limit of tasks changes according to energy
    brain()
    add 1 to tasks</p>
<p>quimzy()

I've found myself thinking about a lot of things, so why not tell some of them to the world.</p>
<p>You can find the stuff i've built on <a href="https://github.com/Quimzy"> my Github </a></p>
<p>I am also a noob scientist, interested in Math, AI &amp; the future.</p>
