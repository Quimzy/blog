<p><strong>WHAT DID WE INVENT IN THE PAST +10 YEARS?</strong></p>
<p>Look around, every technology and platform you are using is only the result of updates of an idea that has came out before the past decade. There are no breakthroughs in any of these: Social Media, Search Engines, Video Sharing, etc... Most of the apps that are thriving in those areas are mostly from the 2000s or the late '90s and '80s. Google (1998), Amazon (1994), Facebook (2004), Tesla (2003)...</p>
<p><strong>Except for AI</strong></p>
<p>Tons of breakthroughs have happened in multiple fields in AI. If you compare Google Translate now with Google Translate 10 years ago, you can see MASSIVE progress in language translation &amp; detection, it's enhancing almost everyday. The same goes with Self-Driving cars, with Tesla's Autopilot and Comma's Openpilot proving that we are getting closer to level 3&amp;4 each day. Computers are getting more intelligent &amp; capable on an enormous rate, and no one can disagree with that.</p>
<p><strong>Now let's see humans...</strong></p>
<p>Some would say that humans' intelligence is still growing in a slow linear way and others would say that we are getting dumber in a fast linear way. I don't care about both views, i only care about that term, <strong>Linear</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's look at this graph: (The exponential growth being the AI's &amp; The linear being Human's)</p>
<p><img alt="Exponential vs Linear Growth" src="https://finstart.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/linear-vs-exponential-5.png" title="Exponential &amp; Linear" /></p>
<p>There's a point where both lines intersect, a.k.a the Singularity. Personally, to know when that point is, we have to look at when humans would be at their maximum stage of dumbness, numbness and consumer-mentality.</p>
<p>And, that's estimated to be when kids born in the years between 2000 and 2019 grows up (future medium age of 35). After the 2000s system's factory produced the dumbest generation in the modern era, which then triggers the post-modern era. The first era where humans don't play a big role in.</p>
<p>While dumbness between humans is spreading really fast, intelligence between computers is spreading at the speed of light.
We can't ignore the fact that there's still highly intelligent people to say the least, yet most of them are working hard to improve technology and making the way for AI whether directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Fighting AI's power by believing in humans and enhancing them is like improving a stick to fight a laser sword from Star Wars. It doesn't matter how much you improve it, to be able to fight with the laser sword you need to have a laser sword as well.</p>
<p>And, to put things on prespective, the stick here would be human intelligence, the improvement would be Elon Musk's Neuralink and the laser sword would be AI. </p>
<p>The chip would be really helpful to disabled people in the next 10 and 20 years. But, trying to make humans smarter and exceed computers with a Neuralink chip is simply not possible. No matter how optimistic you are, simple grade 8 math and two lines on a carthagian graph would tell you that it's not possible. The chip would give a push to increase humanity's intelligence but it would always be linear growth facing an exponential one. The exponential line would always intersect with the linear one and rise above it. Sorry Elon, focus on leaving Earth instead. </p>
<p><strong>The Singularity is most likely to take place in late 2030s - mid 2040s, thanks to Dumb People.</strong></p>
