<p>When the singularity happens, all of us would be unemployed. And, i literally mean <em>ALL OF US</em>. The next 10-15 years are the best years to work in tech and actually contribute something. And, of course that time-span is valid for people who work with AI directly or inderectly (i.e building infrastructure for AI). </p>
<p>But, for CRUD devs and "software engineers", it's gonna take 5 years (maybe less!) for AI to figure out a way to translate business requirements into code. Once AI is able to do that; most coding channels on Youtube would vanish, it would take few months to a year for small-mid companies to get rid of their developement team. It would take two or three years for big "tech" companies to get rid of most of their developers as well.</p>
<p>If you think that this is far fetched, i'd like to mention that we already have the <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">basic technology</a> to make this work but it needs some few tweaks. And, once someone finds a way to do it, he's gonna be the most hated person by devs. And, honestly, i don't mind hate if it's for the sake of a better future and better technology. I wanna build an AI that builds me a spaceship so i can travel the universe, if creating an AI coder would help me to do so, i will do it. </p>

<p>Few years from now, a 6th grade kid would go to a platform and write a description of a dynamic website that he would like to make, the AI generates the code, hosts it on AWS and returns the link for the website in less than a day. It would be having a nice UI/UX, a database, APIs, and a backend.</p>
<p>Now let's see how much time it would take the <strong><em>kid</em></strong> to make the website:
- Learning basic web stuff: HTML &amp; CSS &amp; JS (3 months)
- Learning MERN stack (6 months)
- Learning AWS (1 month)
- Learning some security stuff (1 month)
- Connecting all the stuff together (1 month)</p>
<p><strong>So it would take a 12 year old kid around a year to make a dynamic website.</strong></p>
<p>And don't get me started on how AI is more efficient than humans, the whole thing could be describe in one scentence said by George Hotz: "<strong>Computers don't get drunk</strong>".</p>
