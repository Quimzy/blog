I **HATE** the crypto world. I think that Satoshi is going to be named one of the best figures in the 21st century. I think that Vitalik Buterin is also a genius and Ethereum has built a really cool ecosystem (Solidity, PoW, Merges, etc...)

*But*, companies who are gaining millions worth of crypto with shitty ideas and apps, scamming users and loosers by putting "Blockchain" and "DeFi" in every sentence on their websites, are the real reason why i hated the crypto world.

We're still far from a decentralized world, but there's some players, people who actually want to decentralize power not to scam people by selling garbage pictures for thousands of dollars in crypto. Products like Storj.io and IPFS are really useful and showed great promise and stability compared to other centralized platforms.

We have to decentralize power before it's too late. I don't want to be wireheaded by the global government, until i grow old and die leaving my brain in a vat. Fuck that. That's not immortality nor a way to live. I want to see a world that has decentralized health-care not universal, decentralized facilities, decentralized socities where your rights and responsibilities actually mean something to you and the people.

If you are not working on something like that with your "Decentralized" app, well, fuck off. The internet is already full of scammers and liars. From this decade to 2050, we have to make something useful with Decentralization and AI, they are the only ways to actually fix things and save us from wireheading.

Don't build a company on lies, and remember: "**The better technology always wins and lying always looses**"
