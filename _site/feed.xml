And, i literally mean <em>ALL OF US</em>. The next 10-15 years are the best years to work in tech and actually contribute something. And, of course that time-span is valid for people who work with AI directly or inderectly (i.e building infrastructure for AI).</p>

<p>But, for CRUD devs and “software engineers”, it’s gonna take 5 years (maybe less!) for AI to figure out a way to translate business requirements into code. Once AI is able to do that, most coding channels on Youtube would vanish, it would take few months for small-mid companies to get rid of their developement team, it would take a year or two for big “tech” companies to get rid of most of their developers as well.</p>

<p>If you think that this is far fetched, i’d like to mention that we already have the <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">basic technology</a> to make this work but it needs some few tweaks. And, once someone finds a way to do it, he’s gonna be the most hated person by devs. And, honestly, i don’t mind hate if it’s for the sake of a better future and better technology. I wanna build an AI that builds me a spaceship so i can travel the universe, if creating an AI coder would help me to do so, i will do it.</p>

<p>Few years from now, a 6th grade kid would go to a platform and write a description of a dynamic website that he would like to make, the AI generates the code, hosts it on AWS and returns the link for the website in 2-3 days. It would be having a nice UI/UX, a database, APIs, and a backend.</p>

<p>Now let’s see how much time it would take the KID to make the website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learning basic web stuff: HTML &amp; CSS &amp; JS (3 months)</li>
  <li>Learning MERN stack (6 months)</li>
  <li>Learning AWS (1 month)</li>
  <li>Learning some security stuff (1 month)</li>
  <li>Connecting all the stuff together (1 month)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So it would take a 12 year old kid around a year to make a dynamic website.</strong></p>

<p>And don’t get me started on how AI is more efficient than humans, the whole thing could be describe in one scentence said by George Hotz: “<strong>Computers don’t get drunk</strong>”.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Random" /><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the singularity happens, all of us would be unemployed.

AI mimicks various systems in nature, and the most effective one until now are Neural Networks. And, it works fine, it’s actually really good. An AI agent powered by Deep Learning &amp; Neural Networks is the closest thing we have to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). This technique has enabled DeepBlue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov"> to defeat Kasparov in chess </a>, AlpghaGo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol"> to defeat Lee Sedol in Go </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openpilot"> Openpilot </a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot"> Autopilot </a> to make self-driving cars.</p>

<p>But, like anything the human brain has its flaws. As technology progresses, new problems will emerge and it will require better solutions. And, that would help machines escape <strong>The Human Limit</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Although, the human limit is not purely technological or biological, it’s also psychological. Look at AI today, it’s created by humans. The same humans that want to be in control of the planet and feel superior. I was watching the AlphaGo documentary the other day and i noticed an interesting, yet dangerous behavior. Humans can’t believe that they were beaten by a machine and they kept neglecting the fact that Lee SeDol - arguably the best human to play Go ever -  lost the game.</p>

<p>And, that’s problematic to say the least. The fact that we can’t accept our defeat is what makes us humans and what pushed us to become what we are today. But, i don’t think that it would be good this time. As we are nearing close to the Singularity, we have to accept our <em>fate</em> and stop being negligent for once.</p>

<p>Once we come to terms with reality and accept the Singularity, the AI overloards will <strong>most likely</strong> treat us good. And, we can find a solution to <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/07/rokos-basilisk-the-most-terrifying-thought-experiment-of-all-time.html"> Roko’s basalisk </a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Random" /><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the first years of AI, developers and engineers have dealt with AI as a digital copy of the human brain.

I think that Satoshi is going to be named one of the best figures in the 21st century. I think that Vitalik Buterin is also a genius and Ethereum has built a really cool ecosystem (Solidity, PoW, Merges, etc…)</p>

<p><em>But</em>, companies who are gaining millions worth of crypto with shitty ideas and apps, scamming users and loosers by putting “Blockchain” and “DeFi” in every sentence on their websites, are the real reason why i hated the crypto world.</p>

<p>We’re still far from a decentralized world, but there’s some players, people who actually want to decentralize power not to scam people by selling garbage pictures for thousands of dollars in crypto. Products like Storj.io and IPFS are really useful and showed great promise and stability compared to other centralized platforms.</p>

<p>We have to decentralize power before it’s too late. I don’t want to be wireheaded by the global government, until i grow old and die leaving my brain in a vat. Fuck that. That’s not immortality nor a way to live. I want to see a world that has decentralized health-care not universal, decentralized facilities, decentralized socities where your rights and responsibilities actually mean something to you and the people.</p>

<p>If you are not working on something like that with your “Decentralized” app, well, fuck off. The internet is already full of scammers and liars. From this decade to 2050, we have to make something useful with Decentralization and AI, they are the only ways to actually fix things and save us from wireheading.</p>

<p>Don’t build a company on lies, and remember: “<strong>The better technology always wins and lying always looses</strong>”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Random" /><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I HATE the crypto world.

<p>I don’t believe in conspiracy theories, at least 98% of them. And, the ones that i believe in are not “theories”, they are real. Like the fact that money was backed by gold and now it’s backed by nothing. But, we’re not talking about this now. The term “Agenda 2030” might have come up in a Youtube video or a tweet, and you may have said that it’s bullshit.

<p>It may seem fine at first glance, but if you focus you can notice that it’s a disaster.

<p>Look around, every technology and platform you are using is only the result of updates of an idea that has came out before the past decade. There are no breakthroughs in any of these: Social Media, Search Engines, Video Sharing, etc… Most of the apps that are thriving in those areas are mostly from the 2000s or the late ’90s and ’80s. Google (1998), Amazon (1994), Facebook (2004), Tesla (2003)…</p>

<p><strong>Except for AI</strong></p>

<p>Tons of breakthroughs have happened in multiple fields in AI. If you compare Google Translate now with Google Translate 10 years ago, you can see MASSIVE progress in language translation &amp; detection, it’s enhancing almost everyday. The same goes with Self-Driving cars, with Tesla’s Autopilot and Comma’s Openpilot proving that we are getting closer to level 3&amp;4 each day. Computers are getting more intelligent &amp; capable on an enormous rate, and no one can disagree with that.</p>

<p><strong>Now let’s see humans…</strong></p>

<p>Some would say that humans’ intelligence is still growing in a slow linear way and others would say that we are getting dumber in a fast linear way. I don’t care about both views, i only care about that term, <strong>Linear</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this graph: (The exponential growth being the AI’s &amp; The linear being Human’s)</p>

<p><img src="https://finstart.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/linear-vs-exponential-5.png" alt="Exponential vs Linear Growth" title="Exponential &amp; Linear" /></p>

<p>There’s a point where both lines intersect, a.k.a the Singularity. Personally, to know when that point is, we have to look at when humans would be at their maximum stage of dumbness, numbness and consumer-mentality.</p>

<p>And, that’s estimated to be when kids born in the years between 2000 and 2019 grows up (future medium age of 35). After the 2000s system’s factory produced the dumbest generation in the modern era, which then triggers the post-modern era. The first era where humans don’t play a big role in.</p>

<p>While dumbness between humans is spreading really fast, intelligence between computers is spreading at the speed of light.
We can’t ignore the fact that there’s still highly intelligent people to say the least, yet most of them are working hard to improve technology and making the way for AI whether directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>Fighting AI’s power by believing in humans and enhancing them is like improving a stick to fight a laser sword from Star Wars. It doesn’t matter how much you improve it, to be able to fight with the laser sword you need to have a laser sword as well.</p>

<p>And, to put things on prespective, the stick here would be human intelligence, the improvement would be Elon Musk’s Neuralink and the laser sword would be AI.</p>

<p>The chip would be really helpful to disabled people in the next 10 and 20 years. But, trying to make humans smarter and exceed computers with a Neuralink chip is simply not possible. No matter how optimistic you are, simple grade 8 math and two lines on a carthagian graph would tell you that it’s not possible. The chip would give a push to increase humanity’s intelligence but it would always be linear growth facing an exponential one. The exponential line would always intersect with the linear one and rise above it. Sorry Elon, focus on leaving Earth instead.</p>

<p><strong>The Singularity is most likely to take place in late 2030s - mid 2040s, thanks to Dumb People.</strong></p>
