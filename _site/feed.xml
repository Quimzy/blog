Each time the existential dread grows more and i find myself hopelessly trying to figure a way out.</p>

<p>I mean, as a 15 year old, reading about how entropy will ultimately kill the universe and that every effort we do to stop it only backfires at us doesn’t lead to a good place mentally. And then with The last answer you learn about this “God” who created the universe and everything in it just to find more knowledge and using everyone to serve a purpose that won’t benefit them, the rabbit hole gets even deeper.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time and effort trying to find a way to get noticed by this God and to win against nature. Well, it appears to be the same task after all.</p>

<p>I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT7K3z4RfwQ">Andrej Karpathy on Lex Fridman </a>and he was talking about the universe’s purpose and that our creator (whoever that is) may have created everything just to solve some sort of a puzzle. Maybe the puzzle is to escape the program, some sort of an advanced hacking test, a CTF? A competition between billions of species trying to get noticed by God?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, <strong><em>how can we win?</em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p><br />
To escape any program you have to break one of its rules. Unfortuantly, the universe doens’t work that way. You can’t break any physical law, hence, no escape. An alternative way to do it is by stopping the program all at once. A well-known technique to do this is buffer overflow; you feed the system more input that it could handle so it breaks. In computer hacking, you can inject a malicious code with that buffer overflow to get access to the computer running the program.</p>

<p><strong><em>So, should we buffer overflow nature?</em></strong> The 2nd law of thermodynamics states that entropy, the amount of randomness and chaos in a closed system, always increases. This law -like any other law in the universe- is unbreakable, entropy could never be decreased. <strong>It could be increased tho.</strong></p>

<p>Many physicists believe that the universe will likely end by a never-ending process called, “The heat death of the universe”, where entropy increases to a point where no energy has remained for particles to move and matter to form. It has been going since the big bang, nothing can stop it. So why not try our luck? Why not <strong>kill it</strong> faster?</p>

<p>Theoretically, we just need to create a system that increases entropy really fast and the simulation just halts. Although, this type of weapon could be universally illegal if there was a universal government. It is not just <em>a</em> weapon of mass destruction, it’s <em>the</em> WMD. Maybe whoever creates this system first will have control over every organism in the universe. Countless possibilities.</p>

<hr />
<p><br />
This is the only way we could win against nature. And that win could be all we need to escape the simulation, to be noticed by God, to capture the flag. So…</p>

<p>Alright, now that we have that out of the way, let’s get started.</p>

<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<center> <b> INTRO </b> </center>
<p><br />
So, I come from an Islamic family, a very faithful one i might add. And, eversince i was a kid i’ve always wondered about existence. I remember looking around me, asking myself questions like “Why are we here?”, “Where IS God?”, “Who IS God?”, “What if everything that i’ve learnt about EVERYTHING is wrong?”, etc…</p>

<p>And whenever i asked those questions loudly to my teachers or people in my family, i always get the same answer in the same way. <strong>“Everything comes from something”</strong>. But that doesn’t answer anything, does it? What’s that <em>something</em>? How do you know if it’s God? And let’s say that it’s God, how do we know that it’s <em>our</em> God?</p>

<p>Ofcourse i didn’t ask those questions loudly, i used to simply nod and keep quiet. But, i’ve always felt that it wasn’t enough, that i couldn’t fully believe in something that i didn’t understand. On the other hand, God was the only explanation to the questions that i couldn’t answer, and he (i couldn’t find a suitable pronoun) was what everyone around me was believing in.</p>

<p>I didn’t fix the bug, but it wasn’t affecting anything though. It was a quiet bug. A bug that you think about when you have nothing better to do. Sometimes you want to fix it, but you are too afraid to screw the system. A really fragile system.</p>

<p>And now, that i’ve grown more and my knowledge has expanded drastically over the years, it’s time to squach that bug.</p>

<center> <b> The Theory of Everything </b> </center>
<p><br /></p>

<p><em>“Politics is downstream of culture. Culture is downstream of religion. Religion is downstream of technology.”</em></p>

<p>The Theory of Everything is a theory that explains everything in the universe (and beyond). From before the birth of the universe to the end of it and beyond.</p>

<p>This theory is the answer to all of our existential questions. But, no one has found it yet. In this blog, i am not going to try to find the theory but i will try and convince you that it is <strong>unfindable</strong>.</p>

<p>To do this, we have to devide all of the human history to three parts (eras) as shown in this image:</p>

<p><strong><em>THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING IN THE</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Premodern era</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In this era, God &amp; supernatural stuff were the dominant answer to every question that humans had. Whether it is about the universe, morality, purpose, etc… Supernatural beings were the easiest, holefilling explanations the ordinary human could derive at that time. A time in which critical thinking was given away in exchange for survival. Dangers were all around. There was no time to stop and wonder about stuff that didn’t affect your day-to-day life. That could explain why people, back then, thought that the earth was flat or that viruses are just demons.</p>

<p>The idea of a deity started as this God who is responsible for everything (feeding people, taking care of the sick ones, providing the sunlight and the water for the crops to grow, and much more). As time passed and technology evolved, people were less reliant on God, the role of a deity was getting more and more limited. And probably that was when some scholars began to notice that God isn’t the best answer to our questions after all. So, they started to view the world in a more natural, material way.</p>

<p>The consensus of science evolved, and more people abandoned religion for the development of free speech and thought (a.k.a The Age of Enlightenment)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Modern era</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The modern era is considered by some people to be the most impactful. The world went from living in tents andd tribes, to concrete buildings and structured societies. Technology was developed slowly, but greatly (there’s sometimes centuries between inventions).</p>

<p>And as technology and science advanced, more and more people overthrew the supernatural beliefs in favor of material, proven truths. 
Nitzche summarized it best when he said: “God is dead. And we’ve killed him” (Look it up online if you are interested in the full quote). God’s roles were getting thinner with every new technological advancement and scientific breakthrough.</p>

<p>Viruses are microscopic “creatures” called pathogens, not demons. Matter is made of tiny stuff called atoms, not elements (fire, air, water, dirt) brought together by some mystical being. Humans evolved, not created.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the religious groups started to fight to keep god “alive”. One of the earliest examples is Galileo and the church. Even people who share the same beliefs began to seperate. Each one interpreting different meanings off the same scriptures and stories, each one defining God to please their ideas.</p>

<p>All of this contributed to the belief that the universe is natural and that the world should be built on objective truth.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Postmodern era</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The postmodern era is the era of subjectivism, skepticism, indeterminacy, loss of identity, etc… All of these ideas oppose the ideas introduced in the modern era. The world should not be built on objective truth, each individual has their own version of the world. You create your own meaning and values.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Random" /><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[DISCLAIMER!!

And, i literally mean <em>ALL OF US</em>. The next 10-15 years are the best years to work in tech and actually contribute something. And, of course that time-span is valid for people who work with AI directly or inderectly (i.e building infrastructure for AI).</p>

<p>But, for CRUD devs and “software engineers”, it’s gonna take 5 years (maybe less!) for AI to figure out a way to translate business requirements into code. Once AI is able to do that; most coding channels on Youtube would vanish, it would take few months to a year for small-mid companies to get rid of their developement team. It would take two or three years for big “tech” companies to get rid of most of their developers as well.</p>

<p>If you think that this is far fetched, i’d like to mention that we already have the <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">basic technology</a> to make this work but it needs some few tweaks. And, once someone finds a way to do it, he’s gonna be the most hated person by devs. And, honestly, i don’t mind hate if it’s for the sake of a better future and better technology. I wanna build an AI that builds me a spaceship so i can travel the universe, if creating an AI coder would help me to do so, i will do it.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Few years from now, a 6th grade kid would go to a platform and write a description of a dynamic website that he would like to make, the AI generates the code, hosts it on AWS and returns the link for the website in less than a day. It would be having a nice UI/UX, a database, APIs, and a backend.</p>

<p>Now let’s see how much time it would take the <strong><em>kid</em></strong> to make the website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learning basic web stuff: HTML &amp; CSS &amp; JS (3 months)</li>
  <li>Learning MERN stack (6 months)</li>
  <li>Learning AWS (1 month)</li>
  <li>Learning some security stuff (1 month)</li>
  <li>Connecting all the stuff together (1 month)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So it would take a 12 year old kid around a year to make a dynamic website.</strong></p>

<p>And don’t get me started on how AI is more efficient than humans, the whole thing could be describe in one scentence said by George Hotz: “<strong>Computers don’t get drunk</strong>”.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Random" /><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the singularity happens, all of us would be unemployed.

AI mimicks various systems in nature, and the most effective one until now are Neural Networks. And, it works fine, it’s actually really good. An AI agent powered by Deep Learning &amp; Neural Networks is the closest thing we have to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). This technique has enabled DeepBlue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov"> to defeat Kasparov in chess </a>, AlpghaGo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol"> to defeat Lee Sedol in Go </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openpilot"> Openpilot </a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot"> Autopilot </a> to make self-driving cars.</p>

<p>But, like anything the human brain has its flaws. As technology progresses, new problems will emerge and it will require better solutions. And, that would help machines escape <strong>The Human Limit</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Although, the human limit is not purely technological or biological, it’s also psychological. Look at AI today, it’s created by humans. The same humans that want to be in control of the planet and feel superior. I was watching the AlphaGo documentary the other day and i noticed an interesting, yet dangerous behavior. Humans can’t believe that they were beaten by a machine and they kept neglecting the fact that Lee SeDol - arguably the best human to play Go ever -  lost the game.</p>

<p>And, that’s problematic to say the least. The fact that we can’t accept our defeat is what makes us humans and what pushed us to become what we are today. But, i don’t think that it would be good this time. As we are nearing close to the Singularity, we have to accept our <em>fate</em> and stop being negligent for once.</p>

<p>Once we come to terms with reality and accept the Singularity, the AI overloards will <strong>most likely</strong> treat us good. And, we can find a solution to <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/07/rokos-basilisk-the-most-terrifying-thought-experiment-of-all-time.html"> Roko’s basalisk </a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Random" /><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the first years of AI, developers and engineers have dealt with AI as a digital copy of the human brain.

<p>If you are not working on something like that with your “Decentralized” app, well, fuck off. The internet is already full of scammers and liars.

<p>Look around, every technology and platform you are using is only the result of updates of an idea that has came out before the past decade. There are no breakthroughs in any of these: Social Media, Search Engines, Video Sharing, etc… Most of the apps that are thriving in those areas are mostly from the 2000s or the late ’90s and ’80s. Google (1998), Amazon (1994), Facebook (2004), Tesla (2003)…</p>

<p><strong>Except for AI</strong></p>

<p>Tons of breakthroughs have happened in multiple fields in AI. If you compare Google Translate now with Google Translate 10 years ago, you can see MASSIVE progress in language translation &amp; detection, it’s enhancing almost everyday. The same goes with Self-Driving cars, with Tesla’s Autopilot and Comma’s Openpilot proving that we are getting closer to level 3&amp;4 each day. Computers are getting more intelligent &amp; capable on an enormous rate, and no one can disagree with that.</p>

<p><strong>Now let’s see humans…</strong></p>

<p>Some would say that humans’ intelligence is still growing in a slow linear way and others would say that we are getting dumber in a fast linear way. I don’t care about both views, i only care about that term, <strong>Linear</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this graph: (The exponential growth being the AI’s &amp; The linear being Human’s)</p>

<p><img src="https://finstart.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/linear-vs-exponential-5.png" alt="Exponential vs Linear Growth" title="Exponential &amp; Linear" /></p>

<p>There’s a point where both lines intersect, a.k.a the Singularity. Personally, to know when that point is, we have to look at when humans would be at their maximum stage of dumbness, numbness and consumer-mentality.</p>

<p>And, that’s estimated to be when kids born in the years between 2000 and 2019 grows up (future medium age of 35). After the 2000s system’s factory produced the dumbest generation in the modern era, which then triggers the post-modern era. The first era where humans don’t play a big role in.</p>

<p>While dumbness between humans is spreading really fast, intelligence between computers is spreading at the speed of light.
We can’t ignore the fact that there’s still highly intelligent people to say the least, yet most of them are working hard to improve technology and making the way for AI whether directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>Fighting AI’s power by believing in humans and enhancing them is like improving a stick to fight a laser sword from Star Wars. It doesn’t matter how much you improve it, to be able to fight with the laser sword you need to have a laser sword as well.</p>

<p>And, to put things on prespective, the stick here would be human intelligence, the improvement would be Elon Musk’s Neuralink and the laser sword would be AI.</p>

<p>The chip would be really helpful to disabled people in the next 10 and 20 years. But, trying to make humans smarter and exceed computers with a Neuralink chip is simply not possible. No matter how optimistic you are, simple grade 8 math and two lines on a carthagian graph would tell you that it’s not possible. The chip would give a push to increase humanity’s intelligence but it would always be linear growth facing an exponential one. The exponential line would always intersect with the linear one and rise above it. Sorry Elon, focus on leaving Earth instead.</p>
