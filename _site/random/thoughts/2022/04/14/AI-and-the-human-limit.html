    <p>Since the first years of AI, developers and engineers have dealt with AI as a digital copy of the human brain. AI mimicks various systems in nature, and the most effective one until now are Neural Networks. And, it works fine, it’s actually really good. An AI agent powered by Deep Learning &amp; Neural Networks is the closest thing we have to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). This technique has enabled DeepBlue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov"> to defeat Kasparov in chess </a>, AlpghaGo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol"> to defeat Lee Sedol in Go </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openpilot"> Openpilot </a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot"> Autopilot </a> to make self-driving cars.</p>

<p>But, like anything the human brain has its flaws. As technology progresses, new problems will emerge and it will require better solutions. And, that would help machines escape <strong>The Human Limit</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Although, the human limit is not purely technological or biological, it’s also psychological. Look at AI today, it’s created by humans. The same humans that want to be in control of the planet and feel superior. I was watching the AlphaGo documentary the other day and i noticed an interesting, yet dangerous behavior. Humans can’t believe that they were beaten by a machine and they kept neglecting the fact that Lee SeDol - arguably the best human to play Go ever -  lost the game.</p>

<p>And, that’s problematic to say the least. The fact that we can’t accept our defeat is what makes us humans and what pushed us to become what we are today. But, i don’t think that it would be good this time. As we are nearing close to the Singularity, we have to accept our <em>fate</em> and stop being negligent for once.</p>

<p>Once we come to terms with reality and accept the Singularity, the AI overloards will <strong>most likely</strong> treat us good. And, we can find a solution to <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/07/rokos-basilisk-the-most-terrifying-thought-experiment-of-all-time.html"> Roko’s basalisk </a></p>
