Let's start with the apparent fact: *the world is built of squares and we are dying inside of them*

They won. They truly did. They trapped humanity into small elegant boxes with very low roofs. 

Who am I even talking about? There's no ***They***. We've done this to ourselves. It's not the liberal West, nor the commies, nor the Illumaniti, not even the fucking lizard people. It's us, all along.

A civilization's biggest enemy is **chaos**. That's why we create religions, laws, social norms -- *boxes*. 

That's why melodies now are easy and shallow. That's why every Instagram story is the same as the one before it. That's why each time you go to a new place, you have a deja-vu.

Everyone talks about being different and special and creative. Weirdness has been rendered bland, tasteless, repetitive and orthodox. It's all about corporates, brands, executives, and managers.

You manslaughtered your kids, other people's kids, and even the sperm that hasn't entered the egg yet.

We do all of this to escape; in the hopes of eradicating every trace of disorder around us. And everytime we do this, we die a little more. 

I mean, haven't you heard? *Entropy kills all*.

Oh, I'm sorry. Did I depress you? Was I too nihilistic and pessimistic for you? I wish I could've answered that question with a more pink-y, flower-y world view. But, sadly, I cannot. So bare with me.

Well, first things first, this is NOT a plea for Anarchism. Anarchism is NOT the answer. You will never take down the Meta or the Big Box. Simply, because there's no Meta or Big Box.

There's only a web of interconnected, lower-case metas and boxes. And, you can't escape those by burning down supermarkets, blowing up towers \-whether from inside with a bomb or outside with a plane ;\)\-, or hacking NASA. 


***"Okay then, how can I esca-"***

Can you just wait? I broke the 4th wall twice already. Jeez. TikTok has really made you impacient.

Okay, fine. Here's the answer:
